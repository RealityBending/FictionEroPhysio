**Project Title:** The Role of the Body in the Perception of Reality 

**Project Description**

- Consent Form

- Demographic Questions

- Questionnaires

- Experimental Design

- Debriefing

- Participants

- Risks

**Section A**

No.
A2: Yes.
A10: An experimental manipulation is in place, involving the use of deception through a cover story that presents a different objective and misrepresents the nature of the stimuli (labelling them as AI-generated rather than real images). However, this deception will be clearly explained and debriefed at the end of the experiment. There is a potential risk that participants might feel uncomfortable, especially if they attempt the experiment in a public space. To mitigate this risk, participants will be warned at various stages about what to expect, and the consent form will suggest completing the experiment in a private space. Participants will also be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time if they feel too uncomfortable.

**Section B**

- B.1: Study will attempt to recruit a minimum of 100 adult participants (based on typical samples of similar studies), with no exclusion criteria.
- B.2: Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms such as SONA. The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
- B.3: 
- B.4: Upon signing up for the study, participants will be invited to come to the Psychophysiology lab to complete the experiment
- B.5: No
- B.6: Yes
- B.7: Yes
- B.8: N/A
- B.9: Yes
- B.10: Yes
- B.11: Yes
    B11a:  Raw data will be saved in a private OSF account accessible only to the researcher and the supervisor, and the data made available on Github will be anonymised beforehand. All data will be used for nothing other than the explicit purpose of our study. 
    Participants do not need to provide their names or any other identifying information. The only identifying information we will collect is a participant ID, which will be assigned to each participant. This ID will be used to link the data collected during the experiment with the participant's responses in the questionnaires. To withdraw their data, participants will need to provide their participant ID. We will record behavioral data, 4 EEG channels (used for heartbeat evoked potentials), physiological measures (ECG, PPG, RSP) - used in the physiological tasks - and accelerometer data (used to identify noisy data segments).

- B.12: NO 
    B12a: The anonymized and unidentified data will be made available open-access on OpenNeuro after the experiment completion.
- B.13: Yes
- B.14: N/A
- B.15: Yes
- B.16: Yes
- B.17: Participants will be asked to click a box informing consent for the study.
- B.18: No
- B.19: No
- B.20: No
- B.21: Yes
    B21a: The location of the experiment will be at Psychophysiology lab, during working university hours. The whole procedure should not take any longer than xx from start to finish. This is not antecipated to carry any risks
- B.22: No
